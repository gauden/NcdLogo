A generative identity for the movement raising policy support for the inclusion of Noncommunicable Diseases in the global development agenda. The logo was produced (but never used) as a possible identity for the UN High Level Meeting on Noncommunicable Diseases in September 2011.

## Technical Notes

The identity is written as a Processing Sketch in Java. It runs under Processing 2.2.1 and uses the `opengl` library for the 3D effects.
